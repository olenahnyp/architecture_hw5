# Homework 5: üíª Development of a basic REST-based application with Token authentication

Author: **Olena Hnyp**

## üìù Description

This project consists of a REST-based application implemented using FastAPI. It includes three microservices:

Business Service - fetches song lists from Taylor Swift albums using OpenRouter AI.

Database Service - stores and retrieves songs that a user added to a playlist.

Client Service - acts as an intermediary for adding albums, rating songs, and fetching ratings.

The application is containerized using Docker and includes token-based authentication for secure access.

## üñ• Usage

### How to run the application

üîª [ EXAMPLE BELOW ‚Äì modify as per your needs ] üîª

1. Clone the repository.
2. Start the application using Docker: **docker-compose up --build**.
3. The services will be available at:
- Business Service: http://localhost:8002
- Database Service: http://localhost:8001
- Client Service: http://localhost:8000


### Results

You can test the application using **test.py**. There are six tests in general. Here you can see their results:

1. The first test checks what happens if a user enters album name. As we can see, it returns a message that the album was added to a playlist. It means that all of the songs that are in the album were added to the database.

2. This test checks what happens if I want to check rating of a song that I haven`t rated yet. It returns a message that this song hasn\`t been rated yet.

![test2]('test2.png')

3. In this test we check if the function that rates songs works correctly. 

![test3]('test3.png')

As we can see, everything works fine. We just rated a song from the album folklore that is called 'mirrorball'. It was already in a database. However, we can rate songs that are not in the database as well. They will be automatically added to a playlist too.

4. Here we check if we can get a rating of the song we just rated. As we can see, it is possible to get it now.

5. Also, we can retrieve all of the songs we have in our playlist. Here we checked this function. It returned all of the songs from the album folklore we added previously.

6. Also, I test how it works if a user enter wrong token to authorize. It returns an error.
